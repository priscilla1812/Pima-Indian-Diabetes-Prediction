# Pima Indian Type 2 Diabetes Prediction

**Inspiration:**  Can you build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not?

**Project:** Pima Indian Type 2 Diabetes Prediction

Kaggle datasets: PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset
ML Algorithms like XGBoost, Random Forest, Decision Tree and Logistic Regression were utilized for building predictive models


**PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset**

Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset is one of the ideal datasets for evaluating machine learning algorithms for predicting diabetes (UCI Machine Learning Repository, 1998). This data set has been used by many researchers in predictive analyses.
The dataset consists of data used for diabetes research on women of Pima Indian heritage, aged 21 and over, living in Phoenix, the 5th largest city of the State of Arizona in the USA. The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

**Dataset Description:**

**Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant

**Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

**BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

**SkinThickness**: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)

**Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

**BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

**Pedigree**: Diabetes pedigree function - A function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history.

**Age**: Age in years

**Outcome**: Class variable (0: the person is not diabetic or 1: the person is diabetic)
